## Flat files

* Rows of information stored as text or binary files
* Examples: comma-delimited (CSV) files, spreadsheets

---

## Databases and DBMS

* **Database**: an organized collection of data
* **Database Management System (DBMS)**: computer program that allows you to store and manipulate your data

* Example DBMS: PostgreSQL/PostGIS

---

## The relational model

* Tables (representation of *relations*) can be associated with one another based on common fields

---

## Structure of a database

* **Schema**: structural description of relations (tables) in a database
* **Instance**: specific contents at a given point in time
* **Key**: attribute whose value is unique for each record (or which can be combined with another attribute to make a unique value)
 * Used to establish relationships between tables

## CARTO

* Web-based platform for data management and visualization; uses PostGIS as a backend
* Free trials available and free accounts for students:  https://carto.com/get-started/

---

### Today's data

* Our data for today: traffic accidents in Fort Worth over the past month
* Data available on TCU Online

---

### Brief tour of CARTO

* Adding data to CARTO
* Styling point data

---

### Review: levels of measurement

Explain the following levels of measurement: 

* Nominal
* Ordinal
* Interval
* Ratio

---

### Review: Column types

* Numeric
  + Integers (short or long)
  + Floating-point numbers (float or double)
* Text (string)
* Boolean (true/false)
* Dates

---

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

* Standard syntax for querying & working with databases; available in the SQL pane in CartoDB

Example statement: 

```sql
SELECT * FROM accidents
	WHERE hit_and_run = true
```

---

## Basic SQL statements

* `CREATE TABLE`: used to create a table in the database.  Parameters must be defined with this statement.
* `SELECT`: used to subset databases.  Can be used in concert with: 
* `FROM`: defines the table used to create the subset
* `WHERE`: specifies conditions that will define the subset

---

## Basic SQL statements
 
* `GROUP BY`: specifies how to display the result (aggregation function); used with `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.
* `JOIN`: used to establish relationships between tables in a database
* `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`: used to modify rows in a database table
* `ORDER BY`: sort values in a table (`DESC` for descending order)

---

## Example

```sql
SELECT street_name, COUNT(cartodb_id) as street_count
	FROM accidents
	GROUP BY street_name
	ORDER BY street_count DESC
```

---

### Dates in CARTO

* Temporal animations are available in CartoDB if an appropriate date column is set; in our dataset, this is `crash_date_time`
* To convert columns in CARTO: click the column heading, then choose "Change data type..."

---

### Dates and SQL

```sql
SELECT COUNT(cartodb_id) AS count, 
       DATE_PART('hour', crash_date_time) AS hour 
  FROM accidents
  GROUP BY hour
  ORDER BY count DESC
```
  
---

## Spatial databases

* Key distinction: a spatial database contains a column that stores the **geometry** of the records in the database
* In CARTO, this is column is called `the_geom`
* Analogous to the "Shape" field in ArcGIS
* `the_geom_webmercator`: feature geometry in projected coordinates, with the meter as the unit of measurement

---

## Spatial SQL

* Extends SQL to perform GIS operations on spatial data in the database
* CARTO: a full-fledged spatial database with spatial SQL available

---

### Example: buffering points

```sql
SELECT 
  cartodb_id, ST_Buffer(the_geom_webmercator, 500) as the_geom_webmercator
	FROM accidents
```

---

## GIS functionality in CARTO

* CARTO includes functionality for several common GIS operations with its ANALYSIS options
* Example: what are the nearest accidents to TCU?
