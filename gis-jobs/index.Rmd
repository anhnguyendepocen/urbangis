## Is GIS a career?

* Operating GIS software and pushing buttons in ArcGIS **is not** a career
* However, the ability to **work with geospatial datasets** and **apply geographic analytical techniques** is in high demand!
* Emerging field: _data science_

---

### How can you get your foot in the door? 

My advice: 

* Informational interviews
* Internships
* Independent training and self-study
* Marketing yourself (website, e-portfolio, LinkedIn)
* Staying up to date with the field (blogs, Twitter)

---

## Informational interviews

* A sort of "reverse interview" in which you reach out to professionals to ask them about their experiences in the field
* **DO NOT** make it seem like you are looking for a job (even though you probably are)
* It is better to be known than unknown in a stack of resumes...

---

## Internships

* [Article from *The Chronicle* on "The Employment Mismatch"](https://chronicle.com/article/The-Employment-Mismatch/137625/#id=overview)
* Key quote: "However, it's fundamental abilities that he says recent graduates lack, like how to analyze large amounts of data or construct a cogent argument. **"It's not a matter of technical skill,"** he says, **"but of knowing how to think."** "

---

### Independent training and self-study

* To be successful, your learning has to continue after you leave TCU
* Options: 
    * Online open courseware (e.g. from [Penn State's online MGIS program](http://open.ems.psu.edu/courseware))
    * MOOCs (e.g. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/))


---

### Marketing yourself

* Ask yourselves: if an employer were to Google me, what would they find?  
* Options: website, blog/e-portfolio, LinkedIn
* Good options: Wordpress, Weebly, Wix
