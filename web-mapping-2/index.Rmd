## Basic map design principles

* What makes a good map?

---

## Layout

<span class="footnote">Source: Brewer, *Designing better maps*</span>

---

## Color

## Data classification

## Web map design

* Principles of web map design: 
 * Generalization
 * Scalability
 * Responsive design

---

## Generalization

* Important to consider purpose of your map when selecting resolution of your data

<img src=assets/img/general.png style="width: 800px">


---

## Generalization

* At small scales, lots of detail can be unnecessary and computationally burdensome 
* Large feature services can be very slow in web maps
* When building applications, ask yourself: how much detail do I need?

* In ArcGIS: look for the "Generalization" toolset in the "Cartography" toolbox

---

## Scalability and responsive design

Example: [Educational Attainment in America]()

---

## Enter the "Mapbox Stack"

* Cartographic design: Mapbox Studio
* Building a website: Mapbox GL JS
* Geospatial analysis (in the browser!): Turf.js

---

## Components of a web page

* Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): 
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): 
* JavaScript: language for enabling interactivity on web pages; becoming more and more of a standard

---

## HTML

* Describes the structure of a web page
* Stored in text files with the `.html` suffix
* Elements enclosed in **tags**, designated with `<>`
* DOM: Document Object Model

---

## Sample HTML document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>GEOG 40323</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>GEOG 40323: Urban & Business GIS</h1>
    <p>What a great class!</p>
  </body>
</html>

```

Let's try it out!

---

## CSS

* Used to style the elements in an HTML document
* Can be defined in an external "stylesheet," or in the HTML document itself, enclosed in `<style>` tags

---

## Sample CSS

```css
body {
  background-color: navy;
  color: yellow;
}
h1 {
  color: orange;
  font-family: Courier;
}
```

Let's try it out!

---

## JavaScript

* The *lingua franca* for dynamic content on the web
* Syntax originally derived from Java; however, it is a totally different language
* Self-study resource: [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/)

---

## JavaScript data types

```javascript
// Variables (declared with 'var')
var x = 5;

// Arrays
var vals = [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Objects
var course = {
  num: "GEOG 40323"
  name: "Urban & Business GIS"
}
```

---

## GeoJSON

* JSON: JavaScript Object Notation
* GeoJSON: additional notation for encoding geographic objects
* TopoJSON: like GeoJSON, but encodes topology

--- 

## Example GeoJSON

```javascript
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "Name": "TCU",
        "Description": "Our favorite university!"
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          -97.36283540725708,
          32.70969028343882
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Web mapping APIs

* API: Application Programming Interface
* Can be hosted locally on your machine/server, or accessed through a **content delivery network** (CDN)

---

## Web mapping APIs

* ArcGIS API for JavaScript: https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/
* Leaflet: http://leafletjs.com/
* OpenLayers: http://openlayers.org/

---

## Mapbox APIs

* Mapbox GL JS: next-generation library for interacting with styles designed in the new Mapbox Studio
* Let's take a look: https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/

---

## Turf.js

* Library developed by Mapbox for __in-browser__ spatial analysis
* Let's take a look: http://turfjs.org/
