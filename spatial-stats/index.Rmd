## Statistics

* Definition: **the study of the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.** 
* In turn, an understanding of statistics is fundamental to the GIS practitioner

---

## Measures of central tendency

* Mean
* Median
* Mode

---

## Mean

The *mean* of a sample ($\overline{x}$) is calculated as follows:

$$\overline{x} = \dfrac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n}$$

where $n$ is the number of elements in the sample.  

---

## Median

* The value that separates the *lower half* of a sample from the *upper half* of a sample
* If the sample has an odd number of cases, the median is the exact middle value; if the sample has an even number of cases, the median is the mean of the two middle values

---

## Mode

* Most frequent value in a sample

---

## Variance

* A measure of the **spread** of a sample.  The variance is computed as:

$${\sigma}^2 = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n}$$

or, in simpler terms, the average of the squared deviations of the values of a sample from its mean.  

---

## Standard deviation 

* Computed as the square root of the variance; denoted by $\sigma$.  
* Offers a standardized way to discuss the spread of a distribution.  For example, in a normally distributed sample (more to come on this): 
    * About 67 percent of the values will be within one standard deviation of the mean
    * About 95 percent of the values will be within two standard deviations of the mean
    * About 99 percent of the values will be within three standard deviations of the mean

---

## Z-score

* Often, variables in your analysis will have vastly different measurement scales.  Variables can thus be standardized with the computation of *z-scores*.  
* A z-score is computed as follows:

$$Z = \dfrac{x - \overline{x}}{\sigma}$$

* In turn, a z-score reflects how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean.  

---

## Probability 

* **Probability**: the likelihood of the occurrence of an event
* **Statistical significance**: the probability that an observation/effect is not the result of random chance

---

## The normal distribution 

```{r simple-plot, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

set.seed(1234)
df <- data.frame(cond = factor( rep(c("A","B"), each=200) ), 
                   values = c(rnorm(200),rnorm(200, mean=.8)))

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(df, aes(x=values)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),      # Histogram with density instead of count on y-axis
                   binwidth=.5,
                   colour="black", fill="white") +
    geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666")

```

## Correlation

* Generally speaking, correlation refers to the extent to which two variables covary.  
* The most popular measure of correlation is Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (or Pearson's $r$), which is appropriate for two continuous variables.  
* $r$ ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 reflects an inverse relationship between two variables, and 1 reflects a positive relationship.  If $r$ = 0, no apparent relationship exists.  

---

## Regression

* **Regression analysis** is used to study the relationship between a response variable $Y$ and a series of explanatory variables $X_1 ... X_n$.  
* The general formula of a linear regression function is:

$$Y = a + b_{1}X_{1} + ... + b_{n}X_{n} + e$$

* Our job is to estimate the unknown intercept $a$ and the parameters $b_1 ... b_n$.  $e$ refers to the error, or **residuals**, in our equation.  

---

## Spatial statistics

* Statistical methods make a variety of assumptions about your data; for example, regression assumes that your residuals (errors) are **independent and identically distributed** ($i.i.d$).  
* However, we remember Tobler's First Law of Geography: 

### "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things"

* Given this property of spatial data, we need special methods to account for spatial dependence.  

---

## Exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA)

* Data analysis techniques used to investigate spatial patterns in a dataset
* Used to discover unseen features of datasets; often involves visualization

---

## Mean and median center

* Used to identify the central location of a distribution of features

### Standard deviation ellipse

* Reveals the directional distribution of points; analogous to a standard deviation

### Nearest neighbor 

* Compares the **average** distance from a feature to its neighbor to an **expected** average under conditions of spatial randomness

## Ripley's *K* function

* Checks for clustering/dispersion at multiple scales

---

## Spatial autocorrelation

* **Autocorrelation**: the correlation of a variable with itself
* **Temporal autocorrelation**: similar values in similar time periods
* **Spatial autocorrelation**: when features tend to have similar values to their neighbors (Tobler's first law of geography!)

---

## Spatial weights matrix

* A **spatial weights matrix** is used to conceptualize spatial relationships between features
* Types: distance-decay, contiguity, nearest-neighbor

## Global measures of autocorrelation

* Statistics designed to detect the presence of spatial autocorrelation in a dataset
* Commonly used: Moran's *I*, Geary's *C*

---

## Moran's *I*

* Most commonly-used global autocorrelation statistic
* Values range from -1 to 1; negative values indicate uniformity, positive values indicate clustering

---

## Local measures of spatial autocorrelation

* *Local statistic*: statistic in a spatial dataset that varies from place to place
* Whereas global measures of spatial autocorrelation can describe general characteristics of a dataset, local measures can illustrate **where** clustering is found in your data

---

## Getis-Ord $G_i$

* For a location $i$, the local statistic $G_i$ is computed as:

$$G_{i}(d) = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{j}w_{ij}(d)x_j}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}x_j} \text{ for all }i \neq j$$

* In simpler terms, $G_i$ reflects the relationship between the values of a neighborhood and the overall values of a study area.  High values reflect a clustering of high values; low values reflect a clustering of low values.  
* The $G_i^{*}$ statistic is similar, but includes the value for location $i$ in the neighborhood calculation.  

---

### Local indicators of spatial association (LISA)

* Local form of the Moran's *I*; used to identify clusters and outliers in a dataset

---

## Spatial regression

* Spatial dependence in your data violates some basic assumptions of the regression model
* Alternative: **spatial regression**
 * *Spatial lag model*: The average neighborhood value of the response variable modeled as an explanatory variable
 * *Spatial error model*: Used when residuals (errors) exhibit spatial autocorrelation; accounts for spatial autocorrelation in the error term
