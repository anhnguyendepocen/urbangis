### Issues with urban mapping

* Data acquisition
* Volume of data
* Styling - especially at multiple zoom levels

---

### OpenStreetMap

* The 'Wikipedia' of map data
* User-generated and _open_ data and mapping platform
* Let's take a look: https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/32.7518/-97.3347

---

### Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team

* Network of volunteers that map crisis zones in under-mapped areas
* More information: https://hotosm.org/

---

### OpenStreetMap data

* Entire world available as a 47GB (compressed) XML file
* What if you don't want to set up the data yourself?  

---

## Mapbox

* DC-based startup on the cutting edge of geospatial development
* Best known for products that allow users to generate tiled maps for the web: TileMill (c. 2011), Mapbox Studio Classic (c. 2014), and now Mapbox Studio

---

## Tiled mapping

* To speed browsing, web maps often display map services as "tiles"
* Tiles are defined by their **zoom level** and **coordinates**

### Innovations in tiled mapping

* The old way: _raster tiles_, or tessellations of PNG images that render based on the user's zoom level and coordinates
* The new way: _vector tiles_, which contain __vector data__ rather than pre-rendered images
    * This means that we can style the data in the tiles!

Vector tile example: [Educational Attainment in America](http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/maps/education/index.html#9.93/32.8039/-97.0978)

## Mapbox Studio

* Web-based platform for generating custom vector tiles
* Gives you access to the OpenStreetMap dataset (!) and allows you to upload your own data
* Let's check it out!  https://www.mapbox.com/studio
