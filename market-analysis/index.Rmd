### Doing business geographically

* Let's say you want to open a new franchise for your company.  What do you need to know?  
* Brainstorm!

---

### Doing business geographically

* Activities (among others) might include: 
    * Geodemographic segmentation
    * Trade area analysis
    * Analysis of competitors' locations
    
---

### Geodemographic segmentation

* The partitioning of geographic units (e.g. households, counties) into groups based on common characteristics, then "naming" those groups
* Examples: [Esri Tapestry segmentation](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a7d9f22e1c39413883f60b44392e42d1); [CDRC segmentation (UK)](http://maps.cdrc.ac.uk/#/geodemographics/toac/toac11/BTTTFTT/10/-0.1497/51.4951/)

### How segmentation works

* Most common method for geodemographic segmentation: _k-means clustering_
* Goal: to partition individual units into _k_ groups based on attribute similarity

---

### How k-means clustering works

* _k_ cluster "centers" are chosen for a given distribution of data (either _a priori_ by the analyst or at random)
* Points are assigned to a cluster based on proximity in data space
* Cluster centers are then re-calculated, and points re-assigned based on proximity to the new centers
* The algorithm "converges" when data points stop switching clusters
* Graphical illustration: http://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-k-means-clustering/

### K-means clustering in ArcGIS

* Available via the "Grouping Analysis" tool in the Spatial Statistics toolbox
* Let's try it out!

## Trade area analysis

* Analysis of characteristics of area from which a business generates a majority of its customers
* Trade areas can be defined by: 
    * Euclidean or network distance
    * Customer geography
    * Gravity modeling
    * Common sense

### Business Analyst

* Business Analyst for Desktop: comprehensive add-on to ArcGIS with detailed demographic & business data along with modeling functionality
    * __Expensive!__
* Business Analyst Online: Web-based interface to Business Analyst; less functionality than BA Desktop but very intuitive
* Let's try it out! https://bao.arcgis.com/esriBAO/login/
